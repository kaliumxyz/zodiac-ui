# @zodiac-ui/formula

Formula is a powerful form generator built for Angular. Inspired by Angular Router, Formula
provides a declarative interface for building reactive forms

## Early adopters

Formula is in early development. Please don't use this in production.

## Why Formula?

Forms are complex. Client-side form generation often comes with tradeoffs
in complexity, performance, and ability to handle exceptions to the pattern.

Formula is built with power in mind, utilising the full power of
Angular forms.

Formula is tuned for speed and efficiency. Formula only renders what's necessary.

Formula is designed for maximum flexibility. Create, compose and reuse forms with ease.

## Features

Formula aims to achieve feature symmetry with the `Route` interface from `@angular/router` and
`FormBuilder` from `@angular/forms`.

-   Builder (in progress): A convenient utility for generating Formula objects
-   Renderer (in progress): Automatically synchronises the UI based on the current formula and value
-   FormArray (in progress): Automatically populate array controls based on the current value and expose api
    for adding, moving or removing controls
-   Guards (not supported yet): Contextually control whether a form node can be loaded, activated or deactivated
-   Resolve (not supported yet): Contextually fetch remote or async data
    (eg. populating select options based on the current user)
-   LoadChildren (not supported yet): To allow for code splitting/lazy loading

There will also be some enhancements:

-   FormContainer (in progress): Formula provides a container type useful for adding nodes that do not need a model
    (eg. a submit button)
-   Smart Validators (not supported yet): In addition to the usual validator options, Formula will also support
    validator class tokens that will be instantiated with the Angular injector.

## FormulaBuilder

Formula provides a form builder to construct Formula objects that are used to render forms. 

### API

| Member                                         | Description                                            |
| :--------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `group: FormulaBuildFn<FormulaGroup>`          | Creates a factory for `FormulaType.GROUP` nodes        |
| `array: FormulaBuildFn<FormulaArray>`          | Creates a factory for `FormulaType.ARRAY` nodes        |
| `control:  FormulaBuildFn<FormulaControl>`     | Creates a factory for `FormulaType.CONTROL` nodes      |
| `container:  FormulaBuildFn<FormulaContainer>` | Creates a factory for `FormulaType.CONTAINER` nodes    |

### Usage

Use `FormulaBuilder` to functionally create and compose various form elements together.

```ts
const fb = new FormBuilder()

export const form = (name: string) =>
    fb.group({
        name,
        component: FormContainerComponent
    })
    
export const text = (name: string, label: string) =>
    fb.control({
        name,
        component: TextFieldComponent,
        data: {
            label,
        }
    })
    
export const formula: Formula =
    form("user")(
        text("firstName", "First Name"),
        text("lastName", "First Name")
    )
```

## FormulaDirective

Creates a `FormulaNode` tree that is used to render a form. `FormulaDirective` provides a declarative
approach for dynamic forms creation
`FormulaDirective` requires a `Formula`, if a falsy value is set the view will clear and the
form will get destroyed.

### API

Formula is under active development. The current API is experimental and likely to change
before release.

| Member                                       | Description                                            |
| :------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| `@Input() formula: Formula`                  | The formula to be rendered. See `Formula` for options. |
| `@Input() value: any`                        | Form value setter. Unknown object keys are discarded.  |
| `@Output() valueChanges: EventEmitter<any>`  | Forwards `valueChanges` from `AbstractControl`.        |
| `@Output() statusChanges: EventEmitter<any>` | Forwards `statusChanges` from `AbstractControl`.       |
| `@Output() submit: EventEmitter<any>`        | Forwards `submit` events from a registered `NgForm`.   |
| `setForm(form: NgForm): void`                | Registers a `NgForm` with the outlet.                  |
| `setValue(value: any): void`                 | Immediately patches the value of the form              |

### Usage

The simplest case is a formula with a single field.

```ts
@Component({
    selector: "z-example",
    template: `
        <z-formula [formula]="formula" [value]="value"></z-formula>
    `,
})
export class ExampleComponent {
    value = {
        exampleText: null,
    }

    formula: Formula

    constructor(fb: FormulaBuilder) {
        this.formula = 
            fb.control({
                name: "exampleText",
                component: TextFieldComponent,
                data: {
                    label: "Example Text",
                    placeholder: "Type text here",
                },
            })
    }
}
```

In this example we are declaring a `formula` that contains a single form control called
`exampleText`. It is rendered with a component, which is up to the user to implement. The
concept is similar to that of Angular route components. For example, the `TextFieldComponent`
may be as simple as this:

```ts
@Component({
    selector: "z-text-field",
    template: `
        <label [innerHTML]="ctx.data.label"></label> <input [formControl]="ctx.model" />
    `,
})
export class TextFieldComponent {
    constructor(public ctx: FormulaContext) {}
}
```

Each component in the tree receives a `FormulaContext` containing the `model`, `data` and `resolve`
data.

> **Important note:** Formula components are rendered dynamically. You may encounter errors about missing
ComponentFactory or unknown Provider. Ensure all components are marked as entry components and that all providers
are provided in the NgModule the form gets rendered in. 

## FormulaOutlet

Renders the current `FormulaNode` in the node tree. It is functionally similar to `router-outlet`;
use this directive inside Formula components to render children of the current node.

### Usage

Anywhere in your Formula component template, place a single `z-formula-outlet` tag.

```ts
@Component({
    selector: "z-form-container",
    template: `
        <z-form> <z-formula-outlet></z-formula-outlet> </z-form>
    `,
})
export class FormContainerComponent {}
```

## FormComponent
Selectors: `<z-form>`

A basic wrapper for `NgForm` that forwards native submit events to the root `FormulaOutlet`.
If nested inside another `FormComponent`, renders `<ng-form>` instead of `<form>`. Will throw an error
if not used with `FormulaGroup` or `FormulaArray`


### Usage
